# Ecosystem: Implementation of a Chosen Animal (Theme 4)

- [Description](#description)
- [Included input files](#included-input-files)

This document contains a description of the fourth theme of the project.
This document is structured so that:
- **description** gives an insight into what our "mini-world" should be able to support when the theme is completed.
- **Included input files** shows the files the program should be able to load when the theme is completed.
- **Requirements** overview gives an overview of various requirements that need to be supported.
- **Recommended approach** breaks down various requirements and suggests how you can approach the theme from start to finish.

# Description
Each animal plays a unique role in its ecosystem. This week's task is to choose an animal and implement it in our mini-world. This involves understanding the animal's needs, behavior, and how it interacts with other elements in our ecosystem.

# Included input files
There are no accompanying input files this week. It is therefore your task to create these (if necessary) in accordance with the following requirement specification.

# Requirements overview
When the following requirements are met, theme 4 is completed. This week, there are no input files to help you; you must create your own that fit your chosen animal. It is therefore recommended that you perform an even more stringent object-oriented analysis to start with (see section 4):

- **K4-1**. Choose any "animal" and implement its characteristics and behavior in the ecosystem. The animal must have at least one unique behavior. An animal can also be a fictional animal (as long as you describe it).
- **K4-2**. The animal must be able to interact with existing elements in the ecosystem, including carcasses, plants, and other animals.
- **K4-3**. Simulate the animal's life cycle, including birth, growth, reproduction, and death.
- **K4-4**. Implement the animal's food chain and predator-prey relationships.
- **K4-5**. The animal's presence and behavior must be able to affect the balance and dynamics of the ecosystem.

# Recommended approach
It is recommended to start this week with an in-depth analysis of the chosen animal's biology and ecology. Review the existing elements in the ecosystem and consider how the animal will interact with these. Consider reusing existing code where possible and implement new functions and behavior rules for the chosen animal. Ensure that you document and test the animal's integration into the ecosystem thoroughly.

This week's requirements are even more open than before, and there is therefore an extra large task for you to interpret them and clarify (in the diary) what you have interpreted and why. Also, write about which requirements you have associated with your animal. Since the requirements are more open, it is also more difficult to assess which tests you should write. Therefore, make sure to consider this and test broadly. By tests, we mean unit tests as taught in the course.

Additionally, remember that this is the last week, and you must submit the complete project, including an overall report.
